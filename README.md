# A web app that takes a stock ticker as input and generatea a line chart for the closing price

Created an app on Heroku with interactivity by having the user submit a form which requests data for a stock price for a certain time period. Utilized `reauests` library to fetch stock price data for requested ticker from a public API, converted into a `pandas` dataframe and visualized closing price using plotly line chart.

Here is the [link](https://umitv-dataincubator-project.herokuapp.com/) to the app.
